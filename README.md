# Hey, I'm Johanna
an enthusiastic coder! 👩‍💻 

As an aspiring frontend developer, I juggle HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React to enchant the web. 
My GitHub profile is my digital playground where code art and a touch of humour collide. 

So grab a cup of coffee and let's explore the world of code together! ☕️✨
